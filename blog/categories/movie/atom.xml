    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honestly i don&rsquo;t know why i write this things on my blog that full with programming, coding. what can i say, that movie show me something that is something will become surprise in our life. That movie didn&rsquo;t tell us why we must sympathic to vontae, or why all the fans choose bo callahan. Sometimes something we think it&rsquo;s small but it can have big impact to our life. why clevelend didn&rsquo;t choose bo callahan?, because he lie about his 21st birthday.And why they didn&rsquo;t choose vontae?, because he gave the ball to her sister that die 6 month laters. that nobody know. people just think vontae show off after his touchdown. you didn&rsquo;t know what will happen to your life after you doing something, and you can&rsquo;t expect all the things haapen like what you wish, just do it. we can wait but the time never wait for us.</p>
